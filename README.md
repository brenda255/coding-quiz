# coding-quiz
##Description
In this project I created a coding quiz with a timer. The user has a certain amount of time to get the quiz completed. If they get an incorrect answer, then they are penalized with time off the clock. The quiz ends as soon as the user answers all the questions or until they run out of time. When they are all done, they get to input their initials and see who has the top highscores.
